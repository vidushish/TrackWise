## 📈 Architecture

- **Frontend**: Component-based UI with React.js, routing with React Router, visualizations using Chart.js or Recharts.
- **Backend**: REST API with Express.js & Node.js, secure authentication (JWT/OAuth).
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB: User data, tasks, habits (highly flexible, ideal for rapid changes)

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- All authentication flows secured with JWT or OAuth  
- Passwords hashed and user data protected  
- RESTful API principles followed  
- Concise code style with small variable names and minimal comments (aligned with programming preferences)[1]
